DCIT 205 INTERIM ASSESSMENT


Assignment Overview
You are tasked with creating a 10-page website for the Computer Science Department. This project will allow you to apply your web development skills in a practical context and showcase your understanding of computer science resources. You shouldn’t rebuild(clone) the CS website, rather you should improve it. Either you add new features or you redesign it. 


Permitted Technologies for Development:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
React

Restrictions:
The use of Bootstrap is not allowed.
Other frameworks, languages, or libraries, such as Tailwind CSS, are also prohibited.

Note:
You do not have to complete the backend, just the frontend is fine.

Computer Science Website

I STRONGLY advise you to read and re-read the project requirements and submission section to know exactly what’s expected of you and how to go about the project.

All the best. I can’t wait to see your contributions. Happy Hacking!

# UGCS department web app

University of Ghana Web App for the Computer Science Department (UGCS). 

## Getting Started


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
